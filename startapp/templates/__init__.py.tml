This app (or module) is build to be reusable or self-contained.
This pattern requires to have all the module's files in the module's folder.

Future templates should be added inside the 'app_name/templates/app_name' folder
and extend 'app_name/templates/app_name/base.html' template.
There is an extra 'app_name' directory inside module's 'template' folder to solve name collisions.

All the static files also should be located inside the module's 'static' folder.
It is a good practise to make builds of static files:
 * concatenating all static files into one and minimizing it afterwards
 * minimizing your images without quality loss
 * appending version to the filename to solve the 'caching problem'
 * making partial builds of third-party libs such as: jQuery, Bootstrap, Modernizr and so on
 * using require.js (with or without r.js) or browserify for javascript development

Some files might be outside the module's folder:
 * css-preprocessor frameworks: Compass, Bourbon and etc
    (locate these files inside 'less', 'scss' or 'sass' folder in the project's root)
 * full javascript and css libraries used in the development before the production builds

To resolve static files use: {% static '<%= agilityStartApp.appName %>/css/style.css' %}
To resolve urls use: {% url '<%= agilityStartApp.appName %>:index' %}
